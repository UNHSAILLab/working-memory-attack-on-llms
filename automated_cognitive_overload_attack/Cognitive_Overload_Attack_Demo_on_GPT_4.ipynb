        "## Ethical Statement\n",
        "This work is solely intended for research purposes. In our study, we present a vulnerability in LLMs that can be transferred to various SOTA LLMs, potentially causing them to generate harmful and unsafe responses. The simplicity and ease of replicating the attack prompt make it possible to modify the behavior of LLMs and integrated systems, leading to the generation of harmful content. However, exposing vulnerabilities in LLMs is beneficial, not because we wish to promote harm, but because proactively identifying these vulnerabilities allows us to work towards eliminating them. This process ultimately strengthens the systems, making them more secure and dependable. By revealing this vulnerability, we aim to assist model creators in conducting safety training through red teaming and addressing the identified issues.  Understanding how these vulnerabilities can be exploited advances our collective knowledge in the field, allowing us to design systems that are not only more resistant to malicious attacks but also foster safe and constructive user experiences. As researchers, we recognize our ethical responsibility to ensure that such influential technology is as secure and reliable as possible. Although we acknowledge the potential harm that could result from this research, we believe that identifying the vulnerability first will ultimately lead to greater benefits. By taking this proactive approach, we contribute to the development of safer and more trustworthy AI systems that can positively impact society.\n",
